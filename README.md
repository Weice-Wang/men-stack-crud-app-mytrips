## 1. Project Overview:

My Trips is a travel planning web app that helps users organise and manage their travel plans in one place. Users can create trips, view all their trips in a simple list, and access detailed pages for each trip. Each trip is allowing users to record destinations, dates, activities, accommodation, and estimated costs. The app focuses on clear structure and ease of use, making travel planning more organised and flexible.

The project demonstrates key full-stack development concepts such as user authentication, CRUD operations, dynamic forms, embedded relationships, and RESTful API design.

> MVP User stories are written in the format:
>
> - As a guest, I want to land on a homepage that prompts me to sign up or sign in, so I can access my trips.
> - As a registered user, I want to sign in and be taken directly to my trip dashboard.
> - As a user, I want to be able to add new travel plans, whether they are short-distance or long-distance trips.
> - As a user, when creating a trip, I want to record key details including: Destination, Expected travel date, Estimated cost, Planned activities, and whether I have visited this destination before
> - As a user, I want to see all the trips in one place. This page should just show the date and the destination for each travel to keep it simple and easy.
> - As a user, I need to be able to click on any trip in my list and see all the details about it on a new page. This includes everything I've recorded about that travel plan.
> - As a user, when I’m looking at all the details of a trip, I want to be able to change any of the information. There should be an easy-to-find link that takes me to a different page where I can make these changes and then save them.
> - As a user, if I’m looking at the details of a travel plan, I want a simple way to delete it completely, like clicking a ‘Delete’ button.
